## Webby webserver

This repo contains the code for my blog series on Rust backend [that you can find here](https://www.monocursive.com/articles/an-introduction-to-web-backends-in-rust).

Each blog article has its own branch and you can follow the latest state of the project on the main branch.

Use as you whish and consider it under the WTFPL licence.
